# ðŸ“° Edition

**Edition** is a command-line application for creating beautiful HTML and Markdown editions of your projects' documentation.

In fact, the document you're reading right now was pressed by Edition.

<edition value="toc" />

## Why should you use Edition?

Edition could be great for you if:

- You've tried other documentation tools and they were more complex or time-consuming than you care for
- Your documentation fits on a single page

## Why should you not use Edition?

Edition is not a feature-matching substitute for Sphinx, mkdocs, pdoc or the like, nor is Edition aiming to be.

If you need multi-page documentation, docstring parsing or fine configuration then Edition is not right for you.

```bash
pipenv --help
```

<!--edition-exec-->

Hello?

```python
print("hello")
```

<!--edition-exec-->

Let's take a guess?

    import foo from bar
    print("foo")

right?
